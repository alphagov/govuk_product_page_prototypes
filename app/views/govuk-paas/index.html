        GOV.UK Platform as a Service from GDS is a fast, efficient way to host your government service. It allows you to deploy and host your application in multiple languages and frameworks without building your own hosting infrastructure.</p>

<p>Government PaaS is a cloud-hosting platform being built by the Government Digital Service (GDS). PaaS manages the deployment of your apps, services and background tasks so you don’t need to hire specialist cloud skills to do so.</p>

<aside class="notice">
    Government PaaS is currently in private beta.
</aside>

<p>If you’d like to be one of the early applications going live on the platform, please contact us by emailing <a href="mailto:gov-uk-paas-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk">gov-uk-paas-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk</a>. There is limited availability for these early applications.</p>

      <h1 id="benefits-of-paas">Benefits of PaaS</h1>

<p>Right now, development teams spend considerable time and money setting up all the components required to host a government service (eg, application monitoring, logging and alerting techniques). With Government PaaS, development teams can save on this effort by using a hosting stack that’s already been developed.</p>

<p>Your development team can use PaaS to deploy and run government applications written in a range of languages and web frameworks. You’ll simply need to push your source code to the PaaS environment and the code will be compiled and deployed for you.</p>

<p>PaaS makes user management easy by providing development teams with privilege separation options, eg an ‘admin’ user will be able to assign other team members certain permissions from their PaaS console.</p>

<p>PaaS is deployed to multiple availability zones, making it resilient and accredited for information up to OFFICIAL.</p>

<p>The platform itself will be supported 24/7 by GDS, although this does not include application support.</p>

<p>Features of the PaaS platform currently include:</p>

<ul>
<li>  PostgreSQL and will include database back-ups</li>
<li>  language support as provided by the <a href="http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/">default Cloud Foundry buildpacks</a></li>
<li>  ability to stream application logs to Software as a Service logging platforms</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="toc-ignore">Coding in the open</h3>

<p>We are making all new source code open and reusable at PaaS. You can use our source code if you want to prioritise different backing services (any networked attached service that your application consumes to do its job, eg a MongoDB instance or a PostgreSQL database).</p>

<p>PaaS uses Cloud Foundry and Amazon Web Services (AWS).</p>

<h3 id="cloud-foundry">Cloud Foundry</h3>

<p>The PaaS platform is built using the open source <a href="https://www.cloudfoundry.org/">Cloud Foundry</a> project. Multiple open source products were evaluated before Cloud Foundry was selected as the best fit for PaaS.</p>

<p>We chose Cloud Foundry due to its maturity and because it offered:</p>

<ul>
<li>  a selection of user permissions</li>
<li>  support for a wide variety of languages and frameworks through buildpacks</li>
<li>  a very active community</li>
<li>  an ability to scale easily, performing well under heavy load</li>
</ul>

<p>For more information on why we chose Cloud Foundry, <a href="https://governmentasaplatform.blog.gov.uk/2015/12/17/choosing-cloudfoundry/">read our blog post</a>.</p>

<p>Government PaaS addresses common usability, security, compliance and scalability concerns experienced by government development teams. This makes the platform a superior option to your development team deploying their own version of the Cloud Foundry software, where they’d need to address cloud security implications and build a continuous integration pipeline.</p>

<h3 id="amazon-web-services">Amazon Web Services</h3>

<p>Currently PaaS runs on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a>. As a tenant, you do not have to interact with AWS directly; all interactions required to deploy and manage your service are carried out through Cloud Foundry commands.</p>

<p>The platform may change cloud provider in the future, depending on cost.  Your PaaS interface will always remain the same, no matter which provider is in use. </p>

      <h1 id="pricing">Pricing</h1>

<p>Government PaaS will initially operate using a freemium pricing model.</p>

<p>We will select underlying hosting providers with cost in mind. We can change to a more competitively-priced hosting provider without changing how you interface with PaaS.</p>

<p>Please contact us for pricing details at <a href="mailto:gov-uk-paas-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk">gov-uk-paas-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk</a>.</p>
