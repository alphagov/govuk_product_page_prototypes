    <p>Payment links allow your service to receive online payments from your users. You don’t need to have a digital service to use payment links.</p>

    <p>You can add a payment link to paper forms, letters or emails - or wherever you’d like your users to see it.</p>

      <h2 class="heading-medium">Benefits of using online payments</h2>

      <p>Online payments are 4 times more cost effective than offline methods, like cheques, money orders and cash payments.</p>
      <p>By using self service payments your service can:</p>

      <ul class="list list-bullet"> 
         <li>speed up payment processes - you’ll be able to receive payments and issue refunds much quicker</li>
        <li>reduce human error and have fewer manual processes, like taking card payments over the phone</li>
        <li>receive fewer cheques, BACS and cash payments</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="heading-medium">Setting up a payment link</h2>
      <p>A payment link is quick and easy to set up and is ready to use right away. You don’t need any technical knowledge to create a payment link. You can create a payment link for a single user or make it reusable for all your users.</p>

      <div class="content-image"><img src="/public/images/payment-link-demo-sm.gif" alt=""></div>

      <p>Add the payment link where your users can see it, like in a paper form, letter or email - or even on your website.</p>

      <div class="content-image"><img src="/public/images/payment-link-demo-2.svg" alt=""></div>

      <p>When your users access your payment link, they’ll be able to make an online card payment. Your users will receive a payment reference number and a confirmation email.</p>
