    <p>Payment links allow your service to receive online payments from your users. You don’t need to have a digital service to use payment links.</p>

    <p>You can add a payment link to paper forms, letters, and emails - or wherever you’d like your users to see it. When your users visit your payment link, they’ll be able to make an online card payment to your service.</p>

      <h2 class="heading-medium">Benefits of using online payments</h2>

      <p>Online payments are 4 times more cost effective than offline methods, like cheques, money orders and cash payments.</p>
      <p>By using self service payments your service can:</p>

      <ul class="list list-bullet"> 
        <li>Reduce human error and manual processes</li>
        <li>Speed up payment process and know when you’ve been paid</li>
        <li>Process refunds more easily</li>
        <li>Stop collecting card payment details on paper forms</li>
        <li>Stop telephone call backs to take card payments</li>
        <li>Reduce PCI DSS complexity</li>
        <li>Reduce Cheques, BACS and cash payments</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="heading-medium">Setting up a payment link</h2>
      <p>A payment link is quick and easy to set up and is ready to use right away. You don’t need any technical knowledge to create a payment link.</p>

      <p>You can create a payment link for a single user or make it reusable for other service users.</p>
