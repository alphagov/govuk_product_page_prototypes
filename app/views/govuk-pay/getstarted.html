            <p>You will need to have a contract for Payment Gateway and Merchant Acquiring services with a Payment Service Provider, who will process the payments taken using GOV.UK Pay. </p>

            <p>If you don’t have one already, then avoid any procurement work by signing up with the Government Banking Service. They have an existing contract that’s open to central government and health sector organisations.</p>
