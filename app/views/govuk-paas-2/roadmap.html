        <h1 class="heading-large">Roadmap for GOV.UK Platform as a Service (PaaS)</h1>
            <p>We want to build the PaaS for government based on what you need. This roadmap is a rough indication of what we're planning on building in the near-, medium-, and long-term.</p>

            <p>Items on the roadmap are our current estimate when things will be available on the platform for use by users. If you would like more information about anything we mention below please <a href="/govuk-paas-2/support">get in touch</a></p> 

        <h2 class="heading-medium">Current Offering</h2>

            <p>The following features are available on the PaaS now. You can read more about the detail in our <a href="https://government-paas-developer-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">development documentation</a>.</p>

            <h3 class="heading-small">Platform</h3>

        <h2 class="heading-medium">Requested Features</h2>

            <p>Below are features which people have been asking about, but are not currently in our plans.</p>

            <h3 class="heading-small">Docker</h3>
                <p>Cloud Foundry supports pushing a Docker image as an app. This feature is not currently enabled on the Government PaaS because allowing deployment from Docker images, where the root filesystem is controlled by the tenant, raises additional security concerns: <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/diego-design-notes/blob/c59e475020a22e244c6074f89c45b55f7b1e2867/docker-support.md#docker-in-a-multi-tenant-world">see this note from the CF developers</a> for more details. We hope to enable support for Docker images in the future. If you would like to be able to push Docker images, please <a href="/govuk-paas-2/support">contact our support team</a>, providing details of your use case.
                </p>
            <h3 class="heading-small">Cloud Foundry Route Services</h3>
                <p>The Cloud Foundry command line client has an option to enable you to connect directly to the virtual machines on which your apps run using cf ssh. See the <a href="https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/ssh-apps.html">Cloud Foundry documentation</a> on accessing apps with SSH. This functionality is currently disabled on the Government PaaS. We intend to make it available in future, following security testing.
                </p>
